# UAV-for-Crop-Health-Analysis
UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) can be made capable of providing a health monitoring system for plants. High end cameras gives deep insights whether it is surveillance or any broadcast of events (filming and production). The key benefits of crop analysis includes identifying for plant diseases and crop health by inspecting its colour components. This is done by studying Near Infrared and Multi-Spectral Cameras which help us in obtaining the Red, Green, Blue and Infrared components of a plant and with the help of computer vision. With computer aided image processing. The processing of the video feed captured by a NoIR camera is done with the help of an on-board micro-computer. Additionally autonomous flight, safety failsafe for landing when on low power, mission planning etc. are some of the facilities that can be incorporated in such a UAV to provide a full integrated crop monitoring and analysis system.
